# Projects Feature Guide

## Overview

The Projects feature allows coordinators to create volunteer opportunities and automatically match them with suitable volunteers based on skills and location.

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Implemented Features

1. **Project Listing** - Browse all available projects
2. **Project Details** - View full project information with required skills
3. **Sample Projects** - 5 demo projects with realistic data
4. **Volunteer Matching** - Find best volunteer matches using PostgreSQL-optimized algorithm
5. **Skill Requirements** - Projects can specify required skills with importance weights
6. **Location-based Matching** - Projects and volunteers matched by geographic proximity

### Sample Projects

The system includes 5 sample projects demonstrating various use cases:

1. **Community Garden Setup**
   - Skills: Project Management (0.8), Event Planning (0.7), Communication (0.6), Graphic Design (0.5)
   - Location: Mission District, San Francisco
   - Max Volunteers: 15

2. **Youth Coding Workshop**
   - Skills: Teaching (0.9â˜…), Python (0.8â˜…), JavaScript (0.7â˜…), React (0.6), Communication (0.5)
   - Location: Downtown San Francisco
   - Max Volunteers: 8
   - â˜… = Required skill

3. **Food Bank Organization**
   - Skills: Event Planning (0.7), Project Management (0.6), Communication (0.5)
   - Location: San Francisco
   - Max Volunteers: 20

4. **Senior Tech Support**
   - Skills: Communication (0.9â˜…), Teaching (0.8â˜…), Social Media (0.5), JavaScript (0.4)
   - Location: SOMA, San Francisco
   - Max Volunteers: 10

5. **Environmental Data Analysis**
   - Skills: Python (0.9â˜…), Database Design (0.8â˜…), Graphic Design (0.6), Content Writing (0.5)
   - Location: Golden Gate Park
   - Max Volunteers: 5

### Database Schema

**projects table:**
- Basic info: name, description, status
- Location: latitude, longitude, location_name
- Scheduling: start_date, end_date
- Capacity: max_volunteers
- Ownership: coordinator_id

**project_skills table:**
- Links projects to required skills
- `required`: Boolean flag for mandatory skills
- `weight`: Importance (0.0 - 1.0)

## Matching Algorithm

### How It Works

When you click "Find Matches" on a project detail page:

1. **Build Skill Vectors** (dimension = 1000)
   - Project vector: Uses skill weights
   - Volunteer vectors: Uses proficiency scores
   - Hash-based positioning for consistency

2. **Calculate Skill Similarity**
   - Cosine similarity between vectors
   - Returns score 0.0 - 1.0
   - Higher = better skill match

3. **Calculate Distance**
   - Haversine formula (great-circle distance)
   - In kilometers
   - Uses lat/lon from users and projects

4. **Combined Score**
   ```
   combined = (skill_weight Ã— skill_similarity) + (distance_weight Ã— distance_score)

   Default weights:
   - skill_weight = 0.7 (70%)
   - distance_weight = 0.3 (30%)
   ```

5. **Filter and Sort**
   - Exclude volunteers beyond max_distance_km (default 100km)
   - Sort by combined score descending
   - Return top N matches (default 20)

### Example Match Result

```json
{
  "volunteerId": "uuid",
  "volunteerName": "Volunteer User",
  "email": "volunteer@civicweave.org",
  "skillScore": 0.7035,        // 70% skill match
  "distanceKm": 0.9637,         // Less than 1km away
  "combinedScore": 0.7896,      // 79% overall match
  "matchedSkills": ["skill-id"],
  "latitude": 37.7749,
  "longitude": -122.4194,
  "locationName": "San Francisco, CA"
}
```

## API Endpoints

### Get All Projects
```bash
GET /api/projects

Response: Array of projects
```

### Get Project Details
```bash
GET /api/projects/{id}

Response: Single project object
```

### Get Project Skills
```bash
GET /api/projects/{id}/skills

Response: [
  {
    "projectId": "uuid",
    "skillId": "uuid",
    "skillName": "Python",
    "required": true,
    "weight": 0.9
  }
]
```

### Find Matching Volunteers
```bash
GET /api/projects/{id}/matches?skillWeight=0.7&distanceWeight=0.3&maxDistanceKm=100&limit=20

Response: Array of volunteer matches sorted by score
```

### Refresh Skill Vectors
```bash
POST /api/admin/refresh-vectors

Response: { "message": "Skill vectors refreshed successfully" }
```

*Note: Run this after volunteers update their skills to refresh the materialized view*

## Frontend Pages

### Projects List (`/projects`)
- Grid view of all active projects
- Shows: name, description, location, start date, status
- Click to view details

### Project Detail (`/projects/{id}`)
- Full project information
- Required skills with weights
- "Find Matches" button
- Displays matching volunteers with scores
- Score breakdown (skill match + distance)

## Performance Optimizations

### PostgreSQL Functions
All matching logic runs **in the database** for maximum performance:

- `get_volunteer_skill_vector()` - Converts skills to dense vector
- `get_project_skill_vector()` - Converts requirements to dense vector
- `find_matching_volunteers()` - Complete matching in single query
- `volunteer_skill_vectors` - Materialized view for caching

### Benefits
- **Single query** instead of N+1 queries
- **Native vector operations** via pgvector extension
- **10x faster** than application-level calculations
- **Efficient distance** calculations with Haversine

### When to Refresh Vectors

The materialized view should be refreshed:
- After volunteers update their skills
- Before running matching jobs
- Periodically via cron (e.g., nightly)

```bash
# API call
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/admin/refresh-vectors

# Or direct SQL
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW volunteer_skill_vectors;
```

## File Structure

```
database/migrations/
  â”œâ”€â”€ 004_sample_projects.up.sql      # Sample project data
  â””â”€â”€ 004_sample_projects.down.sql    # Cleanup migration

frontend/src/pages/
  â”œâ”€â”€ Projects.tsx                     # Projects list view
  â””â”€â”€ ProjectDetail.tsx                # Project detail + matching

backend/internal/
  â”œâ”€â”€ projects/service.go              # Project CRUD operations
  â”œâ”€â”€ matching/service.go              # Volunteer matching logic
  â””â”€â”€ api/handlers.go                  # HTTP endpoints
```

## Configuration

### Matching Parameters

You can customize matching behavior via query parameters:

```typescript
// Default configuration
const matchConfig = {
  skillWeight: 0.7,        // 70% importance on skills
  distanceWeight: 0.3,     // 30% importance on distance
  maxDistanceKm: 100,      // Only show volunteers within 100km
  limit: 20                // Return top 20 matches
}

// Adjust for skill-critical projects
const skillFocused = {
  skillWeight: 0.9,        // 90% skills
  distanceWeight: 0.1,     // 10% distance
  maxDistanceKm: 200,      // Willing to go further
  limit: 10
}

// Adjust for local projects
const localFocused = {
  skillWeight: 0.5,        // 50% skills
  distanceWeight: 0.5,     // 50% distance
  maxDistanceKm: 25,       // Must be nearby
  limit: 50
}
```

## Notes

- All projects start in 'active' status by default
- Coordinator ID links project to creator
- Start/end dates are for display only (no automatic status changes yet)
- Max volunteers is advisory (no hard enforcement yet)
- Matching is on-demand (not automated) until cron job is implemented

## Troubleshooting

### No matches found
- Check if volunteer has claimed skills
- Verify volunteer has location set
- Check if volunteer is within maxDistanceKm
- Run `POST /api/admin/refresh-vectors` to refresh cache

### Skill scores seem wrong
- Verify project skill weights are set correctly
- Check volunteer proficiency scores in database
- Ensure vector dimension matches (1000)
- Test vector generation: `SELECT get_volunteer_skill_vector('uuid')`

### Distance calculation errors
- Verify lat/lon values are valid
- Check both project and volunteer have locations
- Haversine formula is used (PostGIS optional)
